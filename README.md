# First Try with Java
Java code written by me before the university (before Sep 2015).

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

This repo contains all the java code that I wrote before [Basics of Java Labs](https://github.com/baatochan/BasicsOfJavaLabs) at the university.
There is not much to see, but I have it as some kind of archive for me.

Everything is in Polish (sic!) :/
