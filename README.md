# First Try with Java
Java code written by me before the university

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

This repo contains all the java code that I've written before [BasicsOfJavaLabs](https://github.com/baatochan/BasicsOfJavaLabs) at the University.
There is not much to see, but I have it as some kind of archive for me.

Everything is in Polish (sic!) :/
